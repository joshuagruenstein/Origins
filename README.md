# Origins

A recursive tree generator inspired by the poem "Origins" by Eric Ormsby.

### Controls

The left and right keys increase the angle for each branch, while the up and down keys increase the growth factor for each limb. Right command decreases zoom, while right option increases it. For an interesting mathematical treat, try pressing and holding the ‘w’ key.
